## San Diego Rust Meetup - December 8th, 2016 ##

Tonight's exercise was to parse PNG files, and try to build a histogram of
color distribution in the PNG image.

The Meetup group was split in to two teams, and each team was free to parse
PNG files with whatever methods they saw fit to use.

The idea for PNG parsing came from https://mht.technology/post/jpeg-rust-2/,
which uses a JPEG version of the image of "Lenna", a model that's been used
for testing image handling code since the early 1970's
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna).

After some time spent hacking by both teams, two different solutions started
to emerge, however, neither team was able to complete the challenge in the
timeframe of the meeting.

The Git repos for both solutions:
- PNG Fabuloso: https://github.com/SDRust/png-fabuloso
- PNG Decode: https://github.com/SDRust/png_decode

Enjoy!
